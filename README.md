# Kodit.io front-end developer's assignment

This is the front-end development assignment of Kodit.io 

### Brief explanation of the chosen visualisation

Tried to implement search functionality for individual items found in the Json Api dataset and later populate the multi-step form which leads to a a bar chart widget. Due to me getting suddenly sick with covid and trying to finish within two days, couldn't finish implementing advanced functionality.

### Quick start

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Serve on localhost:3000
npm start
# Build for production
npm run build
```
